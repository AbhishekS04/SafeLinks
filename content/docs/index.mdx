# Philosophy

SafeLinks is built on the belief that **digital spaces should be calm**. 

Everything we save competes for our attention. SafeLinks provides a quiet vault to store what matters, without the noise of modern "productivity" tools.

## Core Principles

### 1. Intentional Silence
We do not send notifications. We do not have "streaks". We do not nudge you to come back. The vault is there when you need it.

### 2. Typography First
Words matter. The interface recedes to let the content breathe. We use *italics* to highlight the emotional resonance of a link.

### 3. Softness
No sharp edges. No high contrast black-on-white. Just a gentle gradient of grays.
